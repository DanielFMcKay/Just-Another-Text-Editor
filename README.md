### by Dan McKay

* This is the assignment for Week 19 of the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp as offered through UC Berkeley Continuing Education in partnership with edX.

### Overview
* Just Another Text Editor (JATE) is an installable in-browser text editor that can also be installed as a separate app and even used offline. This ReadMe with the original instructions is just a placeholder, as this project is still a work in progress!!

### Installation
* From a Chrome browser, merely click on the install icon at the far right side of the url field.

* For development, to install on your machine from the repo, clone the repo, then run the line "npm run build", followed by the line "npm run dev:start". The app will now be available at the address localhost:3000, and can be installed the same way, preferably from a Chrome browser.

### Usage
As a standalone editor, JATE can edit one text file at a time and automatically save it to cache to be retreived later.

You will deploy this full-stack application to Heroku using the [Heroku Deployment Guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/heroku-deployment-guide).
